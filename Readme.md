**Project Description :**

- A comprehensive user study aimed at understanding and comparing customer satisfaction and response accuracy between chatbot and human support in a customer service setting.
- Conducted user interviews to collect several key variables, including customer satisfaction scores for both chatbot and human support, the frequency of support usage, and the rating of chatbot response accuracy. Furthermore, open-ended questions were included to gather insights to deepen understanding of user experiences.

**Experiment Design** : 

The study design involves participants interacting with both types of support in a sequence (either chatbot first then human, or vice versa), allowing us to explore the impact of the order of interaction on satisfaction. This dual approach helps to differentiate between the effects of the support type itself and the influence of prior experiences with the alternate support type.

The independent variables (IVs) include the type of support (chatbot or human), the order in which participants encounter them, and the frequency of use of customer support. 

Dependent variables (DVs) include customer satisfaction scores and the rating of chatbot response accuracy.

**Analysis :**

- Used repeated measures ANOVA, paired sample t-test for hypothesis testing, and used correlation test (Pearson and Spearman) to find the correlation between chatbot response and user satisfaction, frequency of use, and customer satisfaction respectively.
- For open-ended questions, sentiment analysis of the user responses was conducted to understand the general idea of how the user's experience is during conversation with customer support.
- Used SPSS and Python for running the statistical tests and GPower for power analysis of the tests.

**Result :** 

The major takeaways from the study are as follows :

- **Higher Satisfaction with Human Support:** There is a clear preference for human customer support over chatbots. This is evident from the significant difference in satisfaction scores favoring human support (M=4.50 for humans vs. M=3.08 for chatbots).
- **Order of Interaction is Not Influential**: The order in which customers interact with the support types (human or chatbot first) does not significantly affect their satisfaction. This suggests that customer satisfaction is more influenced by the support type than by any sequence effect.
- **Negative Correlation of Chatbot Accuracy with Satisfaction**: Interestingly, better chatbot response accuracy predicts lower customer satisfaction. This could imply that even accurate chatbots might not meet other customersâ€™ needs or expectations.
- **Frequency of Use and Satisfaction:** There is a negligible correlation between how often customers use the support service and their satisfaction levels, indicating that the frequency of interaction does not majorly impact satisfaction.

**Interpretation and Implications**

- The strong preference for human support underlines the importance of human elements like empathy and personalization in customer interactions, aspects that chatbots may not adequately replicate.
- The lack of sequence effect on satisfaction suggests that customer judgments are more directly influenced by the nature of the support rather than sequential biases.
- The paradox in chatbot accuracy points to the need for a broader understanding of what constitutes a satisfying customer service experience, beyond mere accuracy.
- The minimal role of frequency of support usage in determining satisfaction indicates that the quality of each individual interaction is more crucial than how often support is used.
